# ðŸ’« About Me:
My name is Balazs Toth, I am a university student in hungary at EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LÃ³rÃ¡nd University. My goal is to get a degree here, and to get a job in the field. Alongside school I am taking a DevOps course on Udemy too.
My current hobby project is a web software that is used to help people who work in catering. The software offers a simple billing procedure, is connected to a local database and has a graphical interface, although it is not finished yet.
